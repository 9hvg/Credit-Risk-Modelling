# Credit Risk Modelling

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **multiclass classification model** using **XGBoost** to assess individual credit risk. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a customer falling into different risk categories, enabling informed decisions in the financial sector.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data to prepare it for model training. Steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
  
- **Model Building**: Built a multiclass classification model using **XGBoost**, known for its high performance on tabular data.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implemented hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model for better performance, ensuring it generalizes well on unseen data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **XGBoost**: For model building.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For evaluation metrics and model validation.
